what modifiers + shortcuts can I use in tooling ^\# or \# ?{{{

#+key = app action
^+key = sys action

+   +   ^\# = mash  mash all the modifiers  = most common choices
+   +   ^ # = mish  mash missing option     = hold back on something/alt but related action
?   ?    \# = mosh  opt+cmd modifier        = feels more like holding UP shift (vs down)
#   x   ^\  = cosh  ctrl+opt modifier
#   x    _# = mish  shIfted Modifier but should only be paired with # ?

mouse/track move "pointer" - cursor in a terminal thing

                arrow   compass word    invertT vim
directions:     ^>v<    nesw    urdl    ilkj    ....
                ^<v>    nwse    uldr    ijkl
                ^v<>    uswe    udlr    kjhl
^unik Vdskj <lwjh >rell

additional system actions could use keys:

?   ,.  <>  left/right small/large
+   []  []  left/right
+   -=  -+  small/large
+   /   ?   help?
+   lrud    direction
+   space   common!
+   arrow
+   /?kh    help keys AND show pointer/mouse?
+   z       undo window changes
+   m       mute mic
+   f       siz-full
?   wn      wide/narrow pair?
?   ijkl    move win?
?   p       where is pointer? more proper than w?
-   lrud    move win?   lr collides with load/restore?

?   w       where is cursor? wide vs narrow?

+   r       restore - cant these be automatic?
+   s       save vs spotify - cant these be automatic?

.   d       word-down   / eof?
.   l       word-left   / refresh? layout?
.   r       word-right  / redo/restore
.   u       word-up     / undo

-   k       keyboard shortcuts? nah - use /?
x   m       cursor/pointer/mouse - would rather use for mic
x   m       minify (who ever wants that?)
x   h       hide?
    n       siz-narrow
    p       cursor/pointer/mouse - too close to print?
    s       siz-shorter
    s       spotify? not used so much anymore


    t       siz-taller
x   v       dir-vertical (too close to paste)
x   c       where is pointer/cursor/mouse? cursor/pointer/mouse (too close to cut)

---avoid------avoid------avoid------avoid------avoid------avoid------avoid------avoid---
-   esc     ok but best for modals
-   tab     common?
x   `   ~   toggle?? too far left for multi-modifers
x   eject   dangerous!
x   \   |   vertical? closest horizontal is '-' which is MORE useful as -/+
x   '   '   too close to enter/return?

x  !q       means quit too easily
   -h       dim-height
   -h       dir-horizontal
x  -i       vim-up (obtuse)
x  -j       vim-left (obtuse)
x  -k       vim-down (obtuse)
x  -l       vim-right (obtuse)
   ?w       cursor/pointer/mouse where is it?
   ?w       dim-width  
   ?w       siz-wider

so additional system actions could use modifiers
    ^\
    ^\# = ^\#+eject = !reboot!
     \#
    ^ # = also used by extreme shortcuts like ^#+eject = quit all
     \_ = used by arrows a bit
}}}

additional window properties: (per app?)
    Constraints:
    order       rgsmo processing order, first wins? default 'grson'?
    ratio       aspect ratio range threshold
    gravity     preferred alignment to screen edges
    snap        grid snapping
    magnet      win edge snapping
    overlap     try to stay non-overlap or dont care?

so given a direction (nesw,urdl) do something in that direction:
    resize/grow
    move

cycling thru is nice idea
do move until constrained then do something else?  push against something then grow?
oscillate tween growth/shrink once max/min?
